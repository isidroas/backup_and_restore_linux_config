# Backup and Restore Linux Config
Almost all linux configuration can be done editing files. These scripts allows you to save those files, which usually start by a *dot*.

For example this: https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles

It would be easy to copy and paste all those files, but this tool gives you:
- User specific and common configuration
- Save backup when restoring files
- Show the diff when restoring files
- Dry-run, ask in each file...
