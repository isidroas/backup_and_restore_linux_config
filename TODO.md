- Undertand some suffixes like '.append_only' to not write the entire file by the begining
- Make tests for CI:
  - Docker?
- Functional programming
  - Make a common generator for restore.py and backup.py.
  - It could handle the skipping of some files
- Check that users exist
- Users overriding
    - At least one user should be mandatory in arguments
- Remove the option of allow non user configs (outside of /home/<user<) ?
  - This could simplify things
  - Also the argument could be the path, instead of a name that has not autocomplete
